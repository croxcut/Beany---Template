# 🌿 Beany

**Beany** is a real-time plant disease detection system developed as a thesis project by students from **Our Lady of Fatima University**. The project leverages machine learning and computer vision to assist in early detection of plant diseases, empowering farmers and agricultural stakeholders with fast, on-the-spot diagnostics.
